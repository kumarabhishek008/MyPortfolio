**kumarabhishek008** is an easy-to-customize personal dev portfolio builder that is created with React.js. When you manage the code in a GitHub repository, it will automatically render a webpage with the owner's profile information, including a photo, bio, and repositories. Also, it includes space to highlight your details, job history, education history, skills, and recent blog posts.

It's all possible using [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) (for automatically populating your website with content) and [Article-api](https://github.com/kumarabhishek008/article-api) (for fetching recent blog posts).

## ðŸ›  Installation & Set Up

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.


1. **[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)** the repo so you have your own project to customize. A "fork" is a copy of a repository.

2. Once you've found a home for your forked repository, **[clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository)** it.

3. Change into your new directory.
```sh
cd kumarabhishek008
```

4. Install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

5. Start the development server
```sh
npm start
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Customization

All the magic happens in the file <code>src/config.js</code>. Open it and modify it according to your preference.

These are the default values:

// config.js

## ðŸš€ Deploy

Once you are done with your setup and have completed all steps above, you need to put your website online! The fastest approach is to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) which is completely free.

**1. Github Pages:**
  - Rename your forked repository to <code>username.github.io</code> in github, where <code>username</code> is your GitHub username (or organization name).
  - Open <code>package.json</code>, and change <code>homepage</code>'s value to <code>https://username.github.io</code>.
  
    ```js
    // package.json
    {
      // ...
      "homepage": "https://username.github.io",
    }
    ```

  - Run <code>npm run deploy</code>.
  - If you see only <code>README</code> at <code>username.github.io</code>, be sure to change your GitHub Page's source to <code>gh-pages</code> branch. See [how to](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).

    Your personal portfolio will be live at <code>username.github.io</code>. For more info, visit [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).

<br/>

**2. Other:** You can also host your website to Netlify, Vercel, Heroku, or other popular services. Please refer to this [doc](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment) for a detailed deployment guide.
